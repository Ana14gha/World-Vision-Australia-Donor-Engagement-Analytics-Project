## **World Vision Australia – Supporter Engagement Analytics Project**  
**Focus:** Predictive Modelling, Donor Segmentation, Campaign Performance Analysis, Data Storytelling  

This project was delivered in three interconnected stages, each one building on the last to create a full cycle from understanding the challenge, to uncovering patterns in donor behaviour, to delivering strategies backed by hard numbers and interactive visuals.

### **Stage 1: Defining the Challenge – Client Brief**  
World Vision Australia (WVA), one of the nation’s leading humanitarian organisations, relies heavily on regular donor contributions to fund programs in child sponsorship, emergency relief, and community development. In recent years, donor retention, especially within the first 12 months of sign-up, had become a pressing issue.  

The client brief clarified three main objectives:  
• Increase first-year donor retention without significantly raising campaign costs.  
• Identify which supporter segments respond most positively to different engagement channels.  
• Build a data-driven framework for ongoing campaign decision-making.  

This stage acted as the strategic compass, ensuring that the rest of the analysis remained tightly aligned with WVA’s mission and operational constraints.

### **Stage 2: Diagnostic Analysis – Understanding the Current State**  
Using historical donation, engagement, and campaign data, the analysis aimed to pinpoint exactly where retention was strong and where donors were being lost.  

**Key findings included:**  
• **Retention Gaps:** While donors supporting for over 3 years had retention rates of 80% or higher, first-year donors were retained at just 55%.  
• **High-Value Concentration:** A small segment, 12% of donors, accounted for 35% of total revenue, highlighting the importance of prioritising this group.  
• **Engagement Effectiveness:** Personalised campaigns boosted donation likelihood by 15–20%, with younger supporters responding particularly well to SMS over email.  
• **Seasonal Trends:** End-of-year giving spikes contributed disproportionately to annual revenue, suggesting campaign timing optimisation could yield quick wins.  

The diagnostic stage established a clear, data-backed performance baseline and revealed the high-leverage points for improvement.

### **Stage 3: Campaign Recommendations and Interactive Visualisation**  
Building on the diagnostic insights, predictive modelling was applied to simulate the impact of different engagement strategies. An interactive Power BI dashboard allowed WVA’s leadership to explore “what-if” scenarios, such as changes to communication mix, budget allocation, and donor segment targeting.  

**Notable modelling outcomes:**  
• Raising first-year retention from 55% to 68% would increase annual recurring donations by an estimated 1.8 million AUD.  
• A 10% increase in high-value donor engagement could deliver 1.2 million AUD in additional yearly revenue.  
• Redirecting 15% of the campaign budget toward personalised outreach showed a potential 18% improvement in ROI.  
• Switching a portion of younger donor communications to SMS doubled conversion rates compared to email.  

The dashboard presentation ensured that complex analytics were accessible and actionable for non-technical decision-makers.

## **Business Impact**  

**Advantages**  
The segmentation model enables precise targeting for maximum retention gains. Forecasting tools give leadership confidence to make budget reallocations. Data-driven decisions can be replicated and adapted for future campaigns.  

**Disadvantages**  
Dependence on historical patterns risks missing sudden shifts in donor behaviour. Scaling personalised campaigns requires additional operational resources. Model accuracy depends heavily on data quality and completeness.
