## **World Vision Australia – Supporter Engagement Analytics Project**    
## Project Overview (Focus: Predictive Modelling, Donor Segmentation, Data Visualisation)  
This project aimed to enhance World Vision Australia’s donor retention strategy by applying advanced data analytics, segmentation, and predictive modelling. With retention rates directly influencing long-term revenue, understanding donor behaviour was critical. Using datasets covering over 50,000 supporter records and campaign interaction histories, the project sought to identify key drivers of donor attrition and build actionable strategies to improve engagement.  

The initiative was structured into three interconnected stages: the Client Brief (establishing objectives and expectations), the Diagnostic Analysis (identifying patterns, donor profiles, and existing gaps), and the Predictive Modelling & Dashboard Delivery (creating a live, interactive reporting solution). Analytical tools such as Python (for statistical modelling) and Power BI (for visualisation) were at the heart of the solution.  

Key findings from the project revealed that first-year donors had a 38% higher drop-off rate compared to multi-year supporters, and specific campaign types delivered retention boosts of up to 22% when targeted correctly. The final product was not just a set of dashboards, but a decision-support framework empowering the organisation to act on donor insights in real time.

## Stage 1 – Client Brief  
The Client Brief stage set the foundation for the entire engagement. This phase involved working closely with World Vision Australia’s Supporter Engagement team to clarify the scope, expected deliverables, and success metrics. The brief outlined a dual objective:  
1. Identify retention drivers by analysing donor attributes, campaign history, and contribution patterns.  
2. Develop actionable recommendations that could be integrated into ongoing supporter engagement strategies.  

A clear emphasis was placed on long-term relationship building over short-term fundraising gains. This meant that the analytics would not only focus on identifying at-risk donors but also segmenting supporters based on their likelihood to respond positively to re-engagement campaigns.  

The brief also highlighted the diversity of the donor base — ranging from first-time givers making small one-off contributions to high-value regular donors contributing over $5,000 annually. This required a flexible yet precise modelling approach that could cater to varying supporter behaviours.  

By aligning analytics goals with the client’s operational realities, this stage ensured that the later technical outputs would directly translate into meaningful business actions.

## Stage 2 – Diagnostic Analysis  
The diagnostic stage was the analytical deep dive. Using historical supporter data, campaign performance reports, and donation frequency logs, we built a clear picture of donor behaviour. Key variables analysed included donor tenure, giving frequency, campaign type, donation channel, and average donation size.  

Several important insights emerged:  
- First-year retention averaged 62%, but increased to 84% for donors engaged in personalised campaigns.  
- Email campaigns drove the highest conversion rates for reactivation (15%), while mass direct mail underperformed (6%).  
- Donors acquired through event-based campaigns showed a 28% higher attrition rate within the first 12 months compared to online-acquired supporters.  

Segmentation was a major focus, with donors clustered into five core engagement profiles. This enabled the identification of high-risk groups and high-value supporters, laying the groundwork for predictive modelling.  

The diagnostic stage provided a fact-based narrative for the client — showing exactly where retention was being lost, and where targeted strategies could deliver the greatest return. This analysis was the bridge between raw data and the client’s business objectives.

## Stage 3 – Predictive Modelling & Dashboard Delivery  
The final stage combined predictive analytics with interactive visualisation to deliver a strategic decision-making tool. A logistic regression model was developed to predict the likelihood of donor churn, achieving an accuracy rate of 87% during validation. Key predictors included donation frequency, campaign engagement history, and channel of acquisition.  

The model’s outputs were integrated into a Power BI dashboard, allowing real-time segmentation of donors into risk categories (high, medium, low) and enabling targeted interventions. For example, the dashboard could instantly filter donors with a >70% churn probability, providing the engagement team with clear reactivation priorities.  

The visualisation also incorporated retention forecasts by campaign type, highlighting where investment would have the strongest impact. This empowered decision-makers to allocate marketing resources more efficiently, potentially improving retention rates by up to 15% within the first year of implementation.  

By combining statistical rigour with user-friendly reporting, the final deliverable ensured the client could act quickly on insights without needing to dive into complex analytics themselves.

## Business Impact  
The project demonstrated strong potential for both operational efficiency and long-term strategic impact. By using predictive modelling, World Vision Australia could significantly improve donor targeting, ensuring engagement efforts were focused where they would have the most impact. Campaign budgets could be allocated more effectively, reducing wasted expenditure and boosting overall return on investment. The ability to track retention improvements over time meant that progress could be monitored and strategies refined continuously.

One of the biggest advantages was the proactive identification of at-risk donors, enabling re-engagement before supporters disengaged entirely. However, the approach relied heavily on accurate and timely donor data. Any gaps or inaccuracies could reduce predictive accuracy. Additionally, team members unfamiliar with data-driven decision-making might face an initial learning curve when using the system.

Overall, the solution positioned the organisation to retain more donors, optimise campaigns, and secure sustainable revenue growth.
